SUM & MEAN
==========

simple terminal app example
---------------------------
in c language
-------------

this example accepts a list of positive integers and computes their sum
and average.

The list can be read from standard input (keyboard or file redirection).

The log of what's going on with the computation is printed on the
standard error output stream, while the actual numerical output is
printed on the standard output at the end. This allows to use the app
output as input of a following app, that read from the standard input.
The output created on the standard input and/or the output created on
the standard error can be also saved in different text files.

*The following instructions are given supposing you're yousing the GNU
gcc c language compiler.*

### to compile on linux/MacOS/MSwin+msys2:

make sumean

### to compile MS win+msys2:

mingw32-make sumean

### to run on linux/MacOS/MSwin+msys2

./sumean

### to run on linux/MacOS/MSwin+msys2

### saving the results on an output file

./sumean >out.asc

### to run on linux/MacOS/MSwin+msys2 & logging

**saving the instructions on an output file err.log saving the results
on an output file out.asc this implies you giving input without hints
(blind mode)**

./sumean 2>err.log >out.asc

### to run on MS win cmd shell

sumean
